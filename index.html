        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>In my freshman year of high school, I learned there was a class that taught coding, Word, and a small portion of game development. My interest grew from then and led me to learn languages like Python, Java, and some C# on my own. Now I'm a senior with a major in IT, learning web development and studying to gain the CompTIA A+ and Network+ certifications, loving every moment I learn a new way to tackle tech issues and coding bugs.</p>
        <p>When I'm not coding, I play games like Destiny and Kerbal Space Program and I run a Dungeons and Dragons campaign, that has been going on for a year</p>
